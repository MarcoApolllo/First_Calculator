# First_Calculator
My first GUI calculator app (Python tkinter)

After about 4-5 months of learning how to programm in Python, I have decided to go build something I could actually show off.
It definitely wasn't easy and it took me quite a while to debugg (hopefully almost everything), but I would say it has helped me tremendously. Not only have I improved with the Tkinter library, but I have also gained some much needed project experience.
I am definitely looking forward to more difficult and complex projects.

Yeah and I would say I have gotten the gist of what classes actually do :)
